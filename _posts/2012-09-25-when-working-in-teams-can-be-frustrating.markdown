Most people who have worked with me before know that I work equally well alone or in a team. However the one issue I have, which I guess is just an inherent risk of having so many ideas and styles present in a development team, is random refactoring of code for no good reason.

OK, the code may be inefficient and a bit ugly but when you're making that decision on whether to refractor or not think about what may have lead to the code looking like that in the first place. There may be a good reason for it and although it may make for imperfect code, it may have been the only option at the time. Combined with difficult problems and time constraints the developer may have made the only decision available to them at the time.

I've been in several situations like this before. I've had to make sub-optimal decisions because of the time available to get stuff done. Only to have an angry client a month later because someone else has been into the code after me and made "optimizations" to the "horrible" code they've found, which has subtly broken critical functionality.

The lesson to be learn from this is not to refractor code just for the sake of it, please, unless it's actually causing problems or is just plain broken.
