Well, what a pleasant surprise, what a difference a well placed, and timed, piece of code can make to site activity.

My usual site statistics hover around 25/30 visitors per day, unless I'm drinking heavily and/or have a major code release and they tend to budge up to 100/150 visitors per day to my articles.

Needless to say, I certainly did not expect my article, [/2011/06/18/lulzsec-have-you-been-compromised-check-now/](/2011/06/18/lulzsec-have-you-been-compromised-check-now/) to come anywhere close to generating me a WHOPPING 703 visits yesterday alone!

Thank you to everyone that visited and used the tool, I hope you found the information enlightening and useful.
