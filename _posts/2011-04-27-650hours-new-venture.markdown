Sorry I've been so quiet on here recently, I have been trying to respond to as many comments as possible with regards to the libraries I have created, however, my enthusiasm and support for CodeIgniter has shifted recently to FuelPHP ([www.fuelphp.com](http://www.fuelphp.com)).



In other news though, an opportunity presented itself recently to become my own boss, or at least one of them. I am now, quite happily, a co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of 650hours, [www.650hours.com](http://www.650hours.com)
