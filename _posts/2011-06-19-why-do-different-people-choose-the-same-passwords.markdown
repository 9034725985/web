I've been analysing the 106,399 separate rows of account data from the recent Lulzsec releases, and not only is password re-use rife, but people, for some reason, seem to 'flock' to the same passwords. Below is the top 50 passwords from the data, along with their corresponding count. I have also verified that all these counts are produced from individual accounts and that I have removed all duplicates from the source data.

Want to know if your account details have been posted on the net by Lulzsec? Check out my other blog post [/2011/06/18/lulzsec-have-you-been-compromised-check-now/](/2011/06/18/lulzsec-have-you-been-compromised-check-now/).
